<h2>Ranking</h2>
<p>Below is the current ranking based on 25 features, which were mapped from the US News attributes (65 total).</p>

In this section, I present some initial insight from our dataset.

<h2>Correlations</h2>
<p>Below is a correlation plot of all 25 current indicators from our ranking. Cells in blue correspond to two indicators which are positively associated (correlated). That is, as one increases, the other increases also. More brown cells show negative association: higher values of one variable are associated with lower values of the other.</p>

Details: these 2 components from our "PCA" model explain about 32% of the variability between these countries, based on 25 features (the "indicators").

<p>We're all familiar with various rankings of the world's universities. Recently, however, US News and World Report went a step further with <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/overall-full-list" target="_blank">a ranking of the world's countries</a>. Partly in order to investigate their methodology, I will create my own ranking using publicly accessible data.</p>
<p>On this page, we look into two measures that were part of the ranking: GDP per capita and income equality. The plot shows data for the top 60 "Best Countries" according to US News (to filter, click or double-click on the region labels in the top right).</p>

<div id="toolkit">
	<h2>Toolkit</h2>
	<p>Data munging was done with R. The plot was done in D3 and is based on a template from <a href="https://github.com/novus/nvd3" target="_blank">NVD3</a>. Page styling was done with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> (plus some minor CSS and HTML tweaks - Safari console debugger was very useful!). Everything was packaged together with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org" target="_blank">Flask</a> and deployed on <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='ico/favicon.ico') }}" target="_blank">Favicon</a> is my own, created on <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com" target="_blank">Paper for iOS</a> and converted with <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/" target="_blank">favicon.cc</a></p>
