<h1>Ranking Countries</h1>

<p>We're all familiar with various rankings of the world's universities. Recently, however, US News came out with a<a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/overall-full-list" target="_blank"> ranking of the world's countries</a>. Partly in order to investigate their methodology, this project tried to recreate the US News ranking, to contrast what is shown by propriatary survey data (the basis for the US News ranking) with hard, real metrics that are publicly accessible (which is what this ranking is based on).</p>
<p>Below is the current top 10<a href="{{ url_for('ranking') }}"> (click image to see the full list!):</p>

<h2>Data Explorer</h2>
<p>A feature of the final ranking will be a <b>Data Explorer</b>, like what US News has.</p>

    <h2>Data Details</h2>
    <p>The ranking from US News had 60 "best" countries. These were selected for my plots in the above links. All data is downloaded live from the <a href="http://datacatalog.worldbank.org" target="_blank">World Bank</a> via use of their API.</p>
</div>


<div id="notes">
    <h2>Other Notes</h2>
    <p>One of the project aims is to compare and contrast perception (US News survey data) with measured statistics (World Bank, other data), and perform analyses to determine sensitivity of the various measurements. For example, US News seemed to use unadjusted GDP per capita, while adjusting it for <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppp.asp" target="_blank">purchasing power</a> may be better.</p>
    <p>The project will feature customizable rankings via adjustable weighting of the attributes, so that anyone can find their own "best country."</p>

    <h2>Toolkit</h2>
    <p>Data for the Data Explorer was pre-processed with <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, and the output is a <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org" target="_blank">Bokeh </a>plot. Other data munging was done with R, and the plot from Week 1 was done in D3, based on a template from <a href="https://github.com/novus/nvd3" target="_blank">NVD3</a>. Page styling was done with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> (plus some minor CSS and HTML tweaks - Safari console debugger was very useful!). Everything was packaged together with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org" target="_blank">Flask</a> (forms use <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/wtforms/" target="_blank">Flask-WTF</a>), and deployed on <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='ico/favicon.ico') }}" target="_blank">Favicon</a> is my own, created on <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com" target="_blank">Paper for iOS</a> and converted with <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/" target="_blank">favicon.cc</a></p>
