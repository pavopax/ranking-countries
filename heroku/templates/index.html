<h1>Ranking Countries</h1>

<p>We're all familiar with various rankings of the world's universities. Recently, however, US News came out with a<a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/overall-full-list" target="_blank"> ranking of the world's countries</a>. Partly in order to investigate their methodology, this project tried to recreate the US News ranking, to contrast what is shown by propriatary survey data (the basis for the US News ranking) with hard, real metrics that are publicly accessible (for this ranking).</p>

<p>However, not being able to replicate some of their input features, in this app, you can instead <a href="{{ url_for('rankr') }}">create your own country ranking</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('explorer') }}">explore the data</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Details</h2>
    <p>My data was sourced from 3 locations:

	<li><a href="http://data.worldbank.org" target="_blank">The World Bank - Indicators</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum - Global Competitiveness Index</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.wingia.com/en/services/end_of_year_survey_2015/global_regional_results/9/53/" target="_blank">WIN/Gallup International - End of the Year Survey</a></li>
    </p>
    <p>...which created a problem: different organizations use different country names. I resorted to regex to standardize them.

    <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
    <p>Briefly, this is a Python-flask web application with a PostgreSQL database, all deployed to Heroku. Data for the Data Explorer was pre-processed with <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, and the output is a <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org" target="_blank">Bokeh </a>plot. Other data munging was done with R, and the plot from Week 1 was done in D3, based on a template from <a href="https://github.com/novus/nvd3" target="_blank">NVD3</a>. Page styling was done with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> (plus some minor CSS and HTML tweaks - Safari console debugger was very useful!). Everything was packaged together with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org" target="_blank">Flask</a> (forms use <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/wtforms/" target="_blank">Flask-WTF</a>), and deployed on <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='ico/favicon.ico') }}" target="_blank">Favicon</a> is my own, created on <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com" target="_blank">Paper for iOS</a> and converted with <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/" target="_blank">favicon.cc</a></p>
